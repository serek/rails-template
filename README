This is based on the new rails template stuff by MR Neighborly

a really nice hack is to then do this: 

alias rails="ruby [path to rails] $1 -m  http://tr.im/zactmpl"

this works for me, for zsh.. similar i am sure will work for you

==================================================
This fork just does what i want it to do.
It assumes:

 - test with shoulda.
 - use warden/devise, state_machine, searchlogic
 
All in all, It's bitching (atleast for me).
